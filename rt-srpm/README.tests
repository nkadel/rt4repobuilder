Run these tests with a command similar to this:

RT_DBA_USER=root RT_DBA_PASSWORD=<mysql-passwd> /usr/bin/prove t/*.t t/*/*.t

Notes:
- Most (all?) tests require to be run as "root".
- Some of these tests were not designed to work outside of rt's source
  tree and do not work when being used as a separate test package.
- Some of these tests are quite "chatty".
- Failing tests may leave stray files on the filesystem, which will not be
  automatically deinstalled upon package deinstallation.
- Some tests fail for (yet) undetermined reasons.
