Some random notes on rt on Fedora:


Finalizing the installation
===========================

The default configuration is set up for a mysql/mariadb based rt system.
It requires additional steps to be performed by the sysadmin to be
fully functional.

If you have never set up rt before, proceed as follows:
1. Log-in to the server as root

2. Install a mysql server:
# dnf install mariadb-server

3. Startup the mysql server:
# systemctl start mariadb.service

4. Set up the mysql server.
If not already done, at minimum, you will want to set up a mysql root
password:
# mysqladmin -u root password <mysql-root-password>

5. Edit /etc/rt/RT_SiteConfig.pm to meet your demands.
You will want to compare RT_SiteConfig.pm against RT_Config.pm and
add customized versions of those settings from RT_Config.pm to
RT_SiteConfig.pm.

In particular, you probably will want to add customized versions of
those setting containing "example.com" to your RT_SiteConfig.pm.

6. Initialize rt's mysql database:
# /usr/sbin/rt-setup-database --action init \
  --dba root \
  --dba-password <mysql-root-password>

7. Start/restart apache/httpd:
# systemctl start httpd.service
rsp.
# systemctl restart httpd.service

8. Try to log in:
At this point, you should be able to login into rt on your rt-host via
its web interface as rt-administrator (root), from an arbitrary host with
http:-access to your rt-host:
e.g.:
<your-favorite-browser> http://<rt-host>/rt

You should be greeted with a login window. Login with
Username: root, Password: password.

The next step should be to change your rt's "root" account's password,
otherwise anybody with web access to your site will be able to abuse
your site.

Afterwards, you should be ready to create user accounts, configure
the mail-interface etc.


SELinux
=======
Make sure /var/cache/rt has this SELinux context:
# ls -lZ /var/cache/rt
drwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_cache_t:s0 /var/cache/rt

If not, perform the following to add the required file context:
# semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_cache_t '/var/cache/rt(/.*)?'
# restorecon -R -v /var/cache/rt

Depending on your email-setup, you may also need to set:
# setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail=1


Mariadb/Mysql
=============
Should you be seeing rt related warnings from mariadb/mysql concerning
max_allowed_packet, consider editing /etc/my.cnf to increase
max_allowed_packet, e.g. change /etc/my.cnf to contain

[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=10M
